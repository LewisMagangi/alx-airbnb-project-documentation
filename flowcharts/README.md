# Flowcharts - Airbnb Clone Backend

## Overview

This document contains flowcharts for key backend processes in the Airbnb Clone system. These flowcharts visualize the step-by-step workflow and decision points for critical system operations.

## Property Booking Process Flowchart

### Process Description
The property booking process is one of the most critical workflows in the Airbnb Clone system. It involves multiple validation steps, payment processing, and notification systems to ensure a smooth booking experience.

### Flowchart Steps

#### 1. Start Process
- User initiates booking request
- System receives booking data (property ID, dates, guest count)

#### 2. User Authentication Check
- **Decision**: Is user logged in?
  - **No**: Redirect to login/registration page → Return to booking
  - **Yes**: Continue to next step

#### 3. Property Availability Validation
- **Decision**: Are selected dates available?
  - **No**: Display error message → Show alternative dates → End
  - **Yes**: Continue to next step

#### 4. Guest Count Validation
- **Decision**: Does guest count exceed property limit?
  - **Yes**: Display error message → Allow user to modify → Return to validation
  - **No**: Continue to next step

#### 5. Pricing Calculation
- Calculate base price for selected dates
- Add cleaning fees
- Add service fees
- Calculate taxes based on location
- Apply any discounts or promotions
- Display total cost breakdown

#### 6. Payment Information Collection
- **Decision**: Does user have saved payment methods?
  - **Yes**: Display saved methods → Allow selection
  - **No**: Require payment method entry
- Validate payment method
- **Decision**: Is payment method valid?
  - **No**: Display error → Return to payment entry
  - **Yes**: Continue to next step

#### 7. Booking Rules Validation
- Check minimum stay requirements
- Check maximum stay requirements
- Check advance booking limits
- Check house rules acceptance
- **Decision**: Do all rules pass?
  - **No**: Display violation message → End
  - **Yes**: Continue to next step

#### 8. Host Approval Check
- **Decision**: Is instant booking enabled?
  - **Yes**: Skip to payment processing
  - **No**: Send booking request to host → Wait for approval

#### 9. Host Approval Process (if required)
- Notify host of booking request
- Display guest profile to host
- **Decision**: Does host approve?
  - **No**: Send rejection notification → End
  - **Yes**: Continue to payment processing

#### 10. Payment Processing
- Process payment through gateway
- **Decision**: Is payment successful?
  - **No**: Display payment error → Allow retry → Return to payment
  - **Yes**: Continue to next step

#### 11. Booking Confirmation
- Create booking record in database
- Update property availability calendar
- Generate booking confirmation number
- Set booking status to "Confirmed"

#### 12. Notification System
- Send confirmation email to guest
- Send booking notification to host
- Send SMS notification (if enabled)
- Update user notification history

#### 13. Post-Booking Actions
- Add booking to user's booking history
- Update host's booking dashboard
- Schedule automatic check-in reminders
- Initialize review collection process

#### 14. End Process
- Display booking confirmation page
- Provide booking management options
- Show cancellation policy information

### Decision Points and Error Handling

#### Authentication Failures
- Invalid credentials → Display error → Redirect to login
- Account suspended → Display suspension message → Contact support
- Email not verified → Send verification email → Block booking

#### Availability Conflicts
- Property became unavailable → Show similar properties
- Dates partially available → Suggest alternative date ranges
- Price changed → Display new price → Require confirmation

#### Payment Failures
- Insufficient funds → Display error → Suggest alternative payment
- Card declined → Display error → Allow different card
- Payment gateway error → Display generic error → Log for investigation

#### System Errors
- Database connection error → Display maintenance message
- External service failure → Graceful degradation
- Timeout errors → Allow retry with saved data

### Performance Considerations

#### Response Time Targets
- Availability check: < 2 seconds
- Pricing calculation: < 1 second
- Payment processing: < 30 seconds
- Overall booking process: < 2 minutes

#### Concurrent Booking Handling
- Lock property dates during booking process
- Handle race conditions gracefully
- Implement queue system for high-demand properties
- Provide real-time availability updates

### Integration Points

#### External Services
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe/PayPal integration
- **Email Service**: SendGrid/Mailgun for notifications
- **SMS Service**: Twilio for text notifications
- **Calendar Services**: Google Calendar/Outlook sync

#### Internal Systems
- **User Management**: Authentication and profile services
- **Property Management**: Listing and availability services
- **Notification System**: Multi-channel notification delivery
- **Analytics**: Booking conversion and performance tracking
