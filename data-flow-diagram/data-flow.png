Placeholder for Data Flow Diagram

To create the actual Data Flow Diagram:

1. Visit https://app.diagrams.net/
2. Create a new diagram
3. Follow the instructions in the README.md file
4. Create a comprehensive DFD showing:
   - External entities (rectangles)
   - Processes (circles, numbered 1.0-7.0)
   - Data stores (open rectangles)
   - Data flows (labeled arrows)
5. Export as PNG with filename "data-flow.png"
6. Replace this placeholder file

The diagram should clearly show how data moves through the entire Airbnb Clone system.
